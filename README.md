# interactive-fish-cluser
This project combines a playful p5.js animation of schooling fish with real-world interaction using Arduino. Fish swim and cluster dynamically on a floor-projected screen, while an IR sensor detects physical obstacles placed by users. When an obstacle is sensed, the virtual fish react instantlyâ€”bouncing away as if avoiding collisions.
